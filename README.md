In this project : 
1) I Read from a file of configuration (fstream library) and store its data into variables to be used later in the project.
2) I wrote an AABB Collision detection logic.
3) I centered the name ( sf::Text ) of each shape in its center.
4) I Rendered Rectangle Shapes and Circle Shapes with the name correspand to each of them.
